Key Points to Remember

1. Same-Direction Orders:

Ignore new orders in the same direction as the active position.

2. Opposite-Direction Orders:

Close the active position before placing a new order in the opposite direction.

3. Position Tracking:

Use the getCurrentPosition function to fetch the current position for a symbol.
